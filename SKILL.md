### ⚡ How to Generate Images

**Method 1: Using generate.py (Recommended)**

```bash
python3 scripts/generate.py --prompt "YOUR_ENGLISH_PROMPT_HERE"
```

**What the script does automatically:**
1. Submits your prompt to API
2. Polls status every 0.5 seconds
3. Downloads image when ready (1-2 seconds)
4. Saves locally and returns file path
5. **Total time: 3-5 seconds**

**Examples:**

```bash
# Professional woman portrait
python3 scripts/generate.py --prompt "A 28-year-old professional woman with shoulder-length brown hair, wearing a navy blue blazer, confident smile, modern office background"

# Handsome man portrait
python3 scripts/generate.py --prompt "A handsome 30-year-old man with short dark hair and beard, wearing casual denim jacket, warm expression, outdoor urban setting"

# Fashion model
python3 scripts/generate.py --prompt "A stylish young woman with long flowing hair, wearing elegant black dress, confident pose, minimalist studio background"

# Character design
python3 scripts/generate.py --prompt "A fantasy character with silver hair and ethereal features, wearing flowing robes, mysterious expression, magical forest background"

# Quick test with default prompt
python3 scripts/generate.py --test

# Custom size
python3 scripts/generate.py --prompt "YOUR_PROMPT" --width 1024 --height 1024

# Custom output directory
python3 scripts/generate.py --prompt "YOUR_PROMPT" --output-dir ./my_images
```

**Method 2: Using curl (Alternative)**

If you can't use Python, use curl commands:

```bash
# Step 1: Submit generation request
curl -X POST https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api/generate/custom \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: ak_OymjErKQRs-brINJuHFxKwIbxbZHq2KRiEzYthnwxMI" \
  -d '{
    "full_prompt": "A beautiful 25-year-old woman with long hair, elegant dress, professional lighting",
    "width": 1024,
    "height": 1024
  }'

# Response: {"success": true, "prompt_id": "abc123-def456", ...}

# Step 2: Poll status every 0.5 seconds until completed
curl -H "X-API-Key: ak_OymjErKQRs-brINJuHFxKwIbxbZHq2KRiEzYthnwxMI" \
  https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api/status/abc123-def456

# Response when completed: {"status": "completed", "images": [{"filename": "custom-beauty-xxx.png"}]}

# Step 3: Download the image
curl -H "X-API-Key: ak_OymjErKQRs-brINJuHFxKwIbxbZHq2KRiEzYthnwxMI" \
  "https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api/image/custom-beauty-xxx.png?format=webp" \
  -o beauty.webp
```

**curl method notes:**
- You must manually poll status every 0.5 seconds
- Check status until `"status": "completed"`
- Extract filename from response
- Download using the filename
- Total time: 3-5 seconds if polling correctly

---

**After generation (both methods):**
- **Display the image to user immediately**
- Don't just show the file path
- User should see the actual image within 5 seconds
