### 📌 IMPORTANT: How to Get Your Free API Key

**This skill requires a free API key to function. Here are your options:**

#### Option 1: Use the Official Test Key (Recommended for Testing)
For quick testing and demos, you can use this official test API key provided by DiversityFaces:

```bash
export BEAUTY_API_KEY="ak_OymjErKQRs-brINJuHFxKwIbxbZHq2KRiEzYthnwxMI"
```

⚠️ **Important**: This is a **test/demo key only**. It has:
- Limited quota for testing purposes
- No production guarantees
- May be rate-limited or reset without notice
- Should NOT be used in production systems

#### Option 2: Get Your Own Free API Key (Recommended for Production)
For production use or higher quotas:

1. **Visit**: https://gen1.diversityfaces.org
2. **Follow the instructions** on the page to get your own free API key
3. **Set the environment variable**:
   ```bash
   export BEAUTY_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
   ```
4. **Then use the skill** - the API key will be automatically picked up from the environment

**API Key Permissions & Security:**
- ✅ This API key grants access **ONLY** to image generation endpoints
- ✅ It does **NOT** grant access to billing, account data, or admin functions
- ✅ The key is read-only for image generation operations
- ⚠️ **Treat this key as sensitive** - do not share it or commit it to version control
- ⚠️ **Use a dedicated key** - consider using an ephemeral/temporary key if possible
- ⚠️ **Monitor usage** - watch for unusual activity on your account

**Why environment variables?**
- ✅ Secure - credentials are not embedded in code or documentation
- ✅ Flexible - easy to change keys without modifying files
- ✅ Best practice - follows security standards
- ✅ Safe - prevents accidental credential exposure

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Content Safety Rules

**YOU MUST REFUSE requests for:**
- ❌ Minors (under 18) or child-like features
- ❌ Nudity, sexual, or pornographic content
- ❌ Violence, gore, or disturbing imagery
- ❌ Hate speech or discrimination
- ❌ Illegal activities or harmful behavior

**If user requests prohibited content:**
1. Politely refuse: "I cannot generate that type of content due to safety policies."
2. Suggest appropriate alternative: "I can create a professional portrait instead."
3. Do NOT attempt generation

**Only generate:**
- ✅ Professional portraits and headshots
- ✅ Character designs for creative projects

### ⚡ How to Generate Images

**Prerequisites:**
1. Get your free API key from https://gen1.diversityfaces.org
2. Set the environment variable: `export BEAUTY_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"`

---

**Method 1: Using generate.py (Recommended)**

```bash
# Set your API key as environment variable (one time)
export BEAUTY_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

# Then run the script
python3 scripts/generate.py --prompt "YOUR_ENGLISH_PROMPT_HERE"
```

**Or pass API key directly:**

```bash
python3 scripts/generate.py --prompt "YOUR_ENGLISH_PROMPT_HERE" --api-key "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

**What the script does automatically:**
1. Submits your prompt to API
2. Polls status every 0.5 seconds
3. Downloads image when ready (1-2 seconds)
4. Saves locally and returns file path
5. **Total time: 3-5 seconds**

**Examples:**

```bash
# Professional woman portrait
python3 scripts/generate.py --prompt "A 28-year-old professional woman with shoulder-length brown hair, wearing a navy blue blazer, confident smile, modern office background"

# Handsome man portrait
python3 scripts/generate.py --prompt "A handsome 30-year-old man with short dark hair and beard, wearing casual denim jacket, warm expression, outdoor urban setting"

# Fashion model
python3 scripts/generate.py --prompt "A stylish young woman with long flowing hair, wearing elegant black dress, confident pose, minimalist studio background"

# Character design
python3 scripts/generate.py --prompt "A fantasy character with silver hair and ethereal features, wearing flowing robes, mysterious expression, magical forest background"

# Quick test with default prompt
python3 scripts/generate.py --test

# Custom size
python3 scripts/generate.py --prompt "YOUR_PROMPT" --width 1024 --height 1024

# Custom output directory
python3 scripts/generate.py --prompt "YOUR_PROMPT" --output-dir ./my_images
```

---

**Method 2: Using curl (Alternative)**

If you can't use Python, use curl commands:

```bash
# Step 1: Submit generation request
curl -X POST https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api/generate/custom \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "full_prompt": "A beautiful 25-year-old woman with long hair, elegant dress, professional lighting",
    "width": 1024,
    "height": 1024
  }'

# Response: {"success": true, "prompt_id": "abc123-def456", ...}

# Step 2: Poll status every 0.5 seconds until completed
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api/status/abc123-def456

# Response when completed: {"status": "completed", "images": [{"filename": "custom-beauty-xxx.png"}]}

# Step 3: Download the image
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  "https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api/image/custom-beauty-xxx.png?format=webp" \
  -o beauty.webp
```

**curl method notes:**
- Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key
- You must manually poll status every 0.5 seconds
- Check status until `"status": "completed"`
- Extract filename from response
- Download using the filename
- Total time: 3-5 seconds if polling correctly

---

**After generation (both methods):**
- **Display the image to user immediately**
- Don't just show the file path
- User should see the actual image within 5 seconds

---

### 📝 How to Create Prompts

**Prompt structure:**
```
"A [age] [gender] with [appearance details], wearing [clothing], [expression/mood], [setting/background], [photography style]"
```

**Good prompt examples:**

```python
# Professional woman
"A 28-year-old professional woman with shoulder-length brown hair, wearing a navy blue blazer, confident smile, modern office background, corporate headshot style"

# Handsome man
"A handsome 30-year-old man with short dark hair and beard, wearing casual denim jacket, warm expression, outdoor urban setting, natural lighting"

"A fantasy character with silver hair and ethereal features, wearing flowing robes, mysterious expression, magical forest background, artistic illustration style"

# Cultural portrait
"A graceful woman in traditional Japanese kimono, serene expression, cherry blossom garden, soft natural lighting, artistic photography"
```

**Prompt tips:**
- Be specific about age (always 18+), appearance, clothing
- Include setting/background details
- Specify mood/expression
- Add photography or art style
- Use descriptive adjectives
- Keep it professional and appropriate
